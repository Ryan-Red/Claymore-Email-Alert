# Claymore-Email-Alert
This is a repository of my auto-alert code for my mining rig, running Claymore on Windows 10.

This alerter works through email, and has been configured to send an email when a specific threshold is hit (i.e. when the maximum temperature is above 75 degrees celcius or when the miner is under performing).

This code uses the API provided in the claymore package.

This is configured to use Gmail, but if can be changed to whatever email client you want by using a different SMTP port.

This is just a template, feel free to use it and modify it accordingly.
